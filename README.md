# Netflix-UI-Clone
 In this project, I built a Netflix UI Clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to replicate the visual design and basic functionality of Netflix's homepage. The project features a responsive layout, movie sections with horizontal scrolling, providing a familiar user experience similar to the original Netflix interface.
